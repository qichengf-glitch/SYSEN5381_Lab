🕒 *Estimated Time: 30-45 minutes*

## 📋 Lab Overview

Build a multi-agent system where agents use function calling to interact with external data sources or APIs. Create custom tools and chain agents together to complete a workflow.

---

## ✅ Your Tasks

### Task 1: Create a Custom Tool Function

- [ ] Choose a function that would be useful for your project (e.g., API call, data processing, calculation)
- [ ] Define the function in your script
- [ ] Create tool metadata describing the function's parameters and purpose

### Task 2: Build a 2-Agent Workflow

- [ ] Design Agent 1: Uses your custom tool to fetch or process data

- [ ] Use `agent_run()` from [`functions.py`](functions.py) to chain the agents together

### Task 3: Test and Refine

- [ ] Run your workflow. Refine tool descriptions or agent prompts if needed
