*See set percentages based on overall types of learning activities.*

Together in small teams, students will complete several homework assignments during the course, building cumulatively towards an **AI-powered tool** built in **R** and/or **Python**. Participants will have the opportunity to select from many **Public APIs** to gather data, or contribute their own data. 

> Participants are strongly encouraged to configure their project in a way that will be helpful to their professional goals and/or employer.

## 📊 Assignment Breakdown

| Type | Learning Activity | Percent | Description |
|------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| `HOMEWORK` | **Coding Labs** | 30% | **3 Homework Assignments due, 1 every 3~4 weeks**. For each Homework, participants must compile, refine, and submit the results of their weekly coding lab activities for the last 3 weeks. Homeworks due 11:59 PM pm on each specified due date, 1 week after made available. Please turn in your homework electronically via Canvas. It is the students' responsibility to keep copies of submitted homework. |
| `ACTIVITIES` | **Activities** | 30% | Systematically measures students' engagement in class using routine learning check questions, surveys, small coding questions, etc. Graded on completion (done or not). 15% goes to short activites, with **Lowest Grade Dropped for 5 activities per term.** 15% goes to lengthier, 'lab' activities, with **1 lowest lab grade dropped per term.** |
| `MIDTERM EXERCISE` | **Hackathon** | 10% | Participation in a **24-hour team Hackathon experience**, date **FRIDAY, MARCH 6, 3:30 PM - SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 3:30 PM**. If participant is unable to attend Hackathon, participant may complete an <u>alternate coding challenge online.</u> |
| `TOOL` | **App V1** | 10% | Teams will build a working AI-powered data analytics application, including building LLM queries, APIs, a front-end App. |
| `TOOL` | **App V2** | 10% | Teams will refine their application, adding Retrieval Augmented Generation, Agentic Orchestration, and Tool Calling. |
| `TOOL` | **App V3** / Presentation | 10% | Teams will present their application in a live product demonstration session, to be scheduled in the last week of classes and the study period. Attendance is Mandatory. Distance Learning students may submit a video presenting their poster instead. Details to be announced. |

## 📋 Grading Practices and Policies

- **Late assignments are NOT allowed.** Assignments submitted after the due date are penalized **10% per day**.
- **Extensions** may be considered under extreme extenuating circumstances. *Eg. Medical Crisis, Childcare, Funeral, etc.* Students must request an extension in writing before the deadline (circumstances pending).
- **No Curves**: There will be no curves in this class, as a general rule of thumb. *(Instructor reserves right to adjust this policy if necessary.)*
- **Regrade Appeals**: All appeals must be made to the instructor (and TA when applicable), in writing, with justification, including references to lecture notes or readings within **1 week** after graded material is returned. The entire homework will be re-graded, not merely the part in question. So, a regrade by the instructors may raise or lower the score.

## 📈 Grading Scale

Letter grades will be based on the weighted average specified above and assigned as follows in the table below. For example, a B+ ranges from 89-87%. An 89.4 would round to 89%, giving a B+. An 89.6 would round up to 90% (A-).

| Letter | A+ | A  | A- | B+ | B  | B- | C+ | C  | C- | D+ | D  | D- | F  |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Max    | 100| 96 | 93 | 89 | 86 | 83 | 79 | 76 | 73 | 69 | 66 | 63 | 60 |
| Min    | 97 | 94 | 90 | 87 | 84 | 80 | 77 | 74 | 70 | 67 | 64 | 61 | 0  |
