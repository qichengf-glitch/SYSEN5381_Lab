## 📚 Course Description

Modern engineering systems increasingly rely on **cloud-based**, **AI-driven** data processing, automation, and analytics. This course equips **Systems Engineering** students with the coding skills needed to interact with **cloud-hosted data**, automate workflows, and build scalable **AI-powered apps** and analytics. Students will gain hands-on experience in querying **web APIs**, building **APIs**, and leveraging **AI models** for automation. Topics include **API** calls, querying **Generative AI**, and automation, all to serve automated data reporting. Participants will learn to examine and critique uses of **AI** in modern systems, considering risk, value, tradeoffs, and policy issues for the customer and society. By the end of the course, students will have built **cloud-hosted**, **AI-powered** applications and reporting systems that can dynamically retrieve, process, and visualize data using **generative AI**. 

Students are expected to spend **3-4 hours per week per credit hour**. Intended for graduate students performing technical tasks interested in software development or data analytics.

## 🎯 Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1. **Design data pipelines** that interact with public and private **APIs** to retrieve, process, and analyze structured data for engineering applications.
2. **Build REST APIs** to automate data analytics and **AI** operations.
3. **Build AI-powered applications** using queries to **generative AI** models and **prompt engineering**.

## 📅 Course Format

- **Reverse-classroom hybrid format**, with on-campus and distance learning sections. 
- **3 classes per week** total, including: 
  - **Mondays**: 1 class of instructional activities and discussions
  - **Wednesdays**: 1 class of coding workshop activities and tutorials
  - **Fridays**: 1 weekly 'lab' of coding activities

Students are assigned lectures, demos, and readings each week to learn new techniques. Then, classes are structured as 'lab hours' where they practice and implement their techniques, giving students a mix of group learning and one-on-one time with the professor. Students are expected to come to **Lab Hours** having read the material for the week, ready to apply.

## 🤔 Should I Take This Course?

### 👥 Who Is This Course For?

Do any of the following apply to you? If so, this course may be a great fit for your professional goals:

- [ ] **Systems engineers** who want to build **cloud data pipelines** and automate workflows using **APIs**.
- [ ] **Engineers and analysts** looking to improve their **AI and API interaction skills**.
- [ ] **Engineers** working with **real-time and large-scale data** who need to integrate, process, and report findings from **cloud-based data sources**.
- [ ] **Professionals looking to build AI-driven applications** using **APIs** for chatbot development and intelligent reporting.
- [ ] **Analysts and data scientists** seeking to create **reproducible, automated reports** with **RMarkdown** and **API-driven dashboards**.
- [ ] **Learners** who want **hands-on experience in using LLMs** without needing prior **AI infrastructure** expertise.

This course is ideal for those who want to level up their technical skills in **data engineering**, **automation**, and **AI-powered analytics**.

### 💡 Why This Course?

**Cloud databases**, **APIs**, and **AI-driven automation** are rapidly transforming how engineers access, process, and report data. However, integrating these technologies into company workflows requires training and expertise. This course promotes fluency in **cloud-based data analytics** by focusing on **3 key skills** relevant to modern systems engineers: (1) **Interacting with APIs**; (2) **Automating AI-driven data processing**; and (3) **Building reproducible, automated reporting systems**. By the end of the course, students will not only understand data engineering but also build and deploy applications that leverage **APIs**, **AI**, and **scalable computing**.

### ✨ What Makes This Course Unique?

This course addresses a skills gap in modern engineering education by providing hands-on experience with **cloud computing**, **API development**, and **AI integration**. The **reverse-classroom format** allows students to learn at their own pace while maximizing hands-on lab time for practical application. The course will provide students with marketable skills in high-demand areas of **data engineering** and **AI automation**.

This course is distinct from existing data science courses in that it focuses specifically on **data engineering**, **API development**, and **AI integration** rather than general data analysis. It complements existing courses by providing practical skills for building and deploying **AI-powered apps**.

Additionally, this course includes critical thinking and reviews of **AI applications** from a broader policy and risk perspective. Drawing from key texts in computational social science, this course helps students make specific choices when architecting their system that maximizes the utility of their **APIs** and **AI tools** while minimizing societal risk.
