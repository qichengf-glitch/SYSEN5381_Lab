## ✅ Your Task

Learn how to define functions as tools and use them with an LLM. Understand the basic pattern of function calling.

### 🧱 Stage 1: Understand Function Calling

- [ ] Open [`02_function_calling.py`](02_function_calling.py) or [`02_function_calling.R`](02_function_calling.R) and review the code structure
- Note how `add_two_numbers()` is defined as a function in the global scope
- Review how tool metadata describes the function's parameters and purpose

### 🧱 Stage 2: Modify and Test

- [ ] Create a new function (e.g., `multiply_numbers()` or `subtract_numbers()`)
- [ ] Define tool metadata for your new function
- [ ] Run the script with your new tool and verify it works
