- [ ] **RStudio** (R-focused IDE): 🔗 [Download RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

**Note:** If you install RStudio, R will be installed automatically with it.

### 🧱 Stage 2: Install Python

- [ ] Go to the 🔗 [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [ ] Download the latest version of Python for your operating system
- [ ] Run the installer
- [ ] **Important:** Make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation
- [ ] After installation, update the `PATH` for Python in this repository's [`.bashrc` file](.bashrc)
- [ ] Open **Git Bash** and run `source .bashrc` to load the settings for your session

### 🧱 Stage 3: Install R (if not using RStudio)

- [ ] Go to the 🔗 [CRAN download page](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
- [ ] Select a mirror close to your location
- [ ] Download R for your operating system
- [ ] Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
- [ ] After installation, update the `PATH` and `R_LIBS_USER` for R in this repository's [`.bashrc` file](.bashrc)
- [ ] Open **Git Bash** and run `source .bashrc` to load the settings for your session

### 🧱 Stage 4: Verify Your Installations

- [ ] Open **Git Bash**
- [ ] Test Python by running: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- [ ] Test R by running: `R --version`
