# 📌 LAB

## Build a Shiny App Using Cursor

🕒 *Estimated Time: 30 minutes*

---

## 📋 Lab Overview

Use Cursor to develop a complete Shiny application (R or Python) that implements your API query from [`LAB_your_good_api_query.md`](../01_query_api/LAB_your_good_api_query.md). This lab demonstrates how to leverage AI assistance for full application development, with minimal manual coding required.

## ✅ Your Tasks

### Task 1: Prepare Context and Documentation

- [ ] Gather all relevant documentation and files:
  - Your API query script from the previous lab (e.g., `my_good_query.py` or `my_good_query.R`)
  - The original [`LAB_your_good_api_query.md`](../01_query_api/LAB_your_good_api_query.md) prompt
  - Shiny documentation (R Shiny docs or Python Shiny/Streamlit docs)
  - Any additional READMEs or documentation that might be helpful
- [ ] Create a new folder for your Shiny app (e.g., `02_productivity/shiny_app/` or `02_productivity/app/`)
- [ ] In Cursor, attach all relevant documentation as context:
  - Your query script
  - The LAB prompt
  - At least one type of Shiny documentation (required)
  - Any additional helpful documentation (optional but recommended)

### Task 2: Request App Development from Cursor

- [ ] Ask Cursor to create a Shiny app that:
  - Implements your API query upon user request
  - Has an attractive, modern UI
  - Includes input controls for query parameters (if applicable)
  - Displays results in a clear, formatted way
  - Handles errors gracefully
  - Follows best practices for Shiny app structure
- [ ] Request that Cursor create all necessary files:
  - Main app file (`app.R` for R or `app.py` for Python)
  - UI components
  - Server logic
  - Any helper functions or utilities
  - Requirements/dependencies file (`requirements.txt` or `DESCRIPTION`)
- [ ] Review Cursor's generated code and request any adjustments or improvements
- [ ] Take screenshots of your entire Cursor conversation showing the development process

### Task 3: Test and Refine the Application

- [ ] Install required dependencies (packages for R or Python libraries)
- [ ] Run the application and test it with your API query
- [ ] Verify that:
  - The app starts without errors
  - The UI displays correctly
  - The API query executes successfully
  - Results are displayed properly
  - Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Take screenshots showing:
  - The running application
  - Successful query execution
  - Results displayed in the UI
  - Any error handling scenarios
- [ ] If issues arise, use Cursor to fix them (take screenshots of troubleshooting conversations)
- [ ] Make any final refinements to improve the app's appearance or functionality

### Task 4: Document Your Application

- [ ] Ask Cursor to create a `README.md` for your app folder
- [ ] Include in the README:
  - Overview of what the app does
  - Installation instructions
  - How to run the app
  - API requirements (API key setup, etc.)
  - Screenshots of the app in action
  - Usage instructions
- [ ] Ensure the README follows your documentation standards
- [ ] Take a screenshot of the final README
