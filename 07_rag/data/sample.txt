Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. There are three main types:

1. Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled examples (classification, regression)
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction)  
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment

Popular algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.
