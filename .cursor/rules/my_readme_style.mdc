# README Writing Rules

Apply this rule when creating or editing README and readme-style documentation. Use a **professional, academic** tone and consistent structure so READMEs are clear, navigable, and reusable across projects.

---

## 1. Overall Tone and Voice

### Tone: Professional and Academic

- **Professional**: Precise, consistent terminology; avoid slang and casual phrasing. Use standard technical language appropriate for course or research documentation.
- **Academic**: Favor clarity and accuracy over marketing language. State purpose, scope, and limitations directly. Cite or reference external docs when relevant.
- **Concise**: One idea per sentence where possible. Prefer short paragraphs (2–4 sentences). No filler ("note that", "it is important to", "please be aware that").
- **Neutral and inclusive**: Use "you" or "the user" for instructions; avoid "we" unless referring to the project or team. Use gender-neutral language.

### Phrases to Avoid

- "It is critical/obvious/clear that…"
- "Obviously", "clearly", "as you can see", "it goes without saying"
- "Simply", "just" (when used to downplay steps)
- Vague praise ("powerful", "easy", "great") without concrete description

### Preferred Alternatives

- State facts: "This step configures the API endpoint."
- Explain why: "Including the token in the request is required for authentication."
- Be specific: "The script returns up to 20 rows" instead of "returns a lot of data."

---

## 2. Required README Sections and Order

Use this section order unless the project explicitly needs something different. Omit a section only if it does not apply; do not reorder.

1. **Title and brief description** (required)  
   - One `#` title.  
   - One short paragraph or blockquote stating what the project/script does and for whom.

2. **Overview** (required)  
   - Purpose, scope, and main outcomes (e.g., "Retrieves daily stock prices for a given ticker and date range").  
   - 2–4 sentences.

3. **Prerequisites / Requirements** (required if there are setup steps)  
   - Runtime, language version, tools, accounts, or keys.  
   - Bullet list; link to install docs if needed.

4. **Installation / Setup** (when applicable)  
   - How to get the code and install dependencies.  
   - Short steps; link to a dedicated doc if setup is long.

5. **Usage / How to run** (required for scripts or apps)  
   - Exact commands or steps to run the main workflow.  
   - Include how to customize (e.g., env vars, config files, CLI flags).

6. **Configuration / Environment** (when applicable)  
   - Env vars, `.env` keys, config files.  
   - What each key does; never put real secrets in the README.

7. **API / Data / Integration** (when the project uses an API or defined data)  
   - Endpoint, parameters, auth, and response shape (see "How to document APIs" below).

8. **Project structure / File reference** (optional but recommended)  
   - Main files or folders and their role.  
   - Use relative links (see "How to reference files and folders" below).

9. **Related docs / References** (optional)  
   - Links to lab writeups, papers, external APIs, or other READMEs.

10. **License / Citation** (optional)  
    - Only if the repo specifies license or citation.

Use `---` between major sections if it improves readability. Keep subsections under each with `##` and `###`; do not go deeper than `###` unless necessary.

---

## 3. Header Formatting and Use of Icons

### Heading hierarchy

- **Level 1 (`#`)**: Only for the README title (e.g., project or script name).
- **Level 2 (`##`)**: Required sections (Overview, Prerequisites, Usage, API, etc.).
- **Level 3 (`###`)**: Subsections within a section (e.g., "Query parameters", "Response fields").

Use sentence-style capitalization for headings (capitalize first word and proper nouns only), or title-style consistently; do not mix.

### Icons

- **Use sparingly and consistently.** Prefer one icon per main section (e.g., one at the start of "Usage" or "API") rather than every heading.
- **Reserve icons for:**  
  - Section headers that benefit from a quick visual cue (e.g., Setup, Usage, API, Troubleshooting).  
  - Warnings, tips, or "Back to top" links.
- **Avoid:** Decorative icons in every line or in the middle of paragraphs.
- **Suggested mapping** (adjust per project):
  - Setup / install: 🔧 or 📦
  - Usage / run: ▶️ or 🚀
  - API / data: 🔌 or 📡
  - Configuration / env: ⚙️
  - Warnings: ⚠️ or 🚨
  - Tips: 💡
  - Back to top: 🏠 or ←

Place the icon at the start of the heading, with a space before the text, e.g. `## Usage` or `## API`.

---

## 4. How Code Blocks Should Be Written

### Language tags

- **Always** specify a language for fenced code blocks so syntax highlighting works:
  - Shell commands: `bash` or `sh`
  - Python: `python`
  - R: `r`
  - JSON: `json`
  - Generic config: `text` or `yaml` as appropriate
- Example: ` ```bash ` for a shell snippet, ` ```json ` for a sample response.

### Content rules

- **Runnable**: Commands and snippets should be copy-pasteable and work as shown (no placeholders like `your_key` unless you explain them in the surrounding text).
- **Minimal**: Prefer the shortest example that demonstrates the point. Omit unrelated code.
- **Commented**: Add brief comments for non-obvious lines (e.g., "# Optional: set date range").
- **Paths**: Prefer relative paths (e.g., `./scripts/run.sh`) or document the assumed working directory (e.g., "From repo root:").

### Placement

- Put the code block immediately after the sentence that introduces it.
- If the snippet comes from a file, say so and link the file: "From `scripts/run.sh`:" then the block, or "See [`scripts/run.sh`](scripts/run.sh) for the full script."

### Line length and length of blocks

- Prefer lines under ~80–100 characters when possible; break long commands with `\` (bash) or explain a two-step approach.
- Prefer one logical step per block (e.g., one "install" block, one "run" block). Split long procedures into multiple blocks with short captions (e.g., "Install dependencies", "Run the script").

## 5. How to Document APIs

When the README describes an external API or an API used by the project, include the following in a dedicated **API** (or **Integration**) section.

### Endpoint and method

- **Base URL** and **path** (e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1/resource`).
- **HTTP method** (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
- One sentence on what the endpoint does.

### Authentication

- How auth is done (e.g., query param `token`, `Authorization` header, API key in body).
- Where the key comes from (e.g., "Set `API_KEY` in `.env`") and that it must not be committed.

### Parameters

- Use a **table** when there are more than two parameters.
- Columns: **Parameter**, **Type**, **Required** (Yes/No), **Description**.
- For path/query/body params, note where they go (path, query, body).
- Example:

  | Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description                    |
  |-----------|--------|----------|--------------------------------|
  | `ticker`  | string | Yes      | Stock symbol (path).           |
  | `startDate` | string (YYYY-MM-DD) | No | Start of range (query). |
  | `token`   | string | Yes      | API key (query).               |

### Request example

- One minimal example: method, URL (or path + base), and key headers.
- For POST, include a minimal JSON body if relevant.

### Response: data structure

- **Format**: e.g., "JSON array of objects."
- **Fields**: Table with **Field**, **Type**, **Description**.
- **Sample**: One short JSON example (single object or 1–2 array elements). Use a fenced `json` code block.

### Errors and limits

- Brief note on HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 401, 429) or link to official docs.
- Rate limits or pagination if they matter for usage.

Keep API docs in the README to one place (one section plus optional "See also" link to official API docs).

## 6. How to Reference Files and Folders

### General rule

- **Always** use **relative** paths from the README's location.
- **Always** turn file and folder names into **links** when they are the main subject of the sentence (e.g., "Edit `config.yaml`" can stay as inline code; "See config.yaml for options" should link: "[`config.yaml`](config.yaml)").

### File references

- **Format**: `` [`filename.ext`](path/to/filename.ext) ``.
- **Same directory as README**: `` [`script.py`](script.py) ``.
- **Subdirectory**: `` [`scripts/run.sh`](scripts/run.sh) ``.
- **Parent directory**: `` [`../README.md`](../README.md) ``.
- Use the **actual filename** in the link text (with backticks) so the doc stays correct when the link is broken or viewed in plain text.

### Folder references

- Prefer linking to a **file inside** the folder (e.g., the folder's README or main script) rather than to the folder itself, when the goal is to send the user to content.
- If you do refer to a folder by name, use inline code: "Run from the `scripts/` directory" or "Output is written to `output/`."

### Activity / lab / reading links (course repos)

- When linking to ACTIVITY_, READ_, or LAB_ docs, use **human-readable titles** as link text and the filename in the URL:
  - `[ACTIVITY: Short Title](ACTIVITY_filename.md)`
  - `[READ: Short Title](READ_filename.md)`
  - `[LAB: Short Title](LAB_name.md)`
- For code or script files, keep filename-as-link: `` [`script.py`](script.py) ``.

### Path consistency

- Use forward slashes in links and paths (`scripts/run.sh`), including on Windows, in markdown.
- Do not use absolute or machine-specific paths (e.g., `/Users/name/project/`) in the README.
