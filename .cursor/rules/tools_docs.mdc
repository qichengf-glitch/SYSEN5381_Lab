# TOOL_ Documentation Rules

## File Naming Convention
- **TOOL** prefix: Formal tool assignments that require building and deploying applications (e.g., `TOOL1.md`, `TOOL2.md`)
- Tools are group assignments that build cumulatively towards a complete AI-powered application
- Each TOOL represents a version of the application (V1, V2, V3) with increasing complexity

---

## Common Structure

### Required Header Format
```markdown
# 📌 TOOL

## App V[X]: [App Name/Description]

🕒 *Estimated Time: X hours*
```

### Required Footer Format
```markdown
![](../docs/images/homework.png)

---

← 🏠 [Back to Top](#TOOL)
```

**Note**: The footer image path should be adjusted based on file location. Use relative path to `docs/images/homework.png`.

---

## TOOL_ Files (Tool Assignments)

### Purpose
Group assignments that require teams to build and deploy working AI-powered applications. Each TOOL builds on previous versions, adding new capabilities and complexity. Tools must be deployed and accessible online.

### Key Characteristics
- **Group assignment** (not individual like HOMEWORK)
- **Deployment required** - app must be deployed and accessible online
- **Simple checklist format** for app requirements
- **Cursor encouraged** - explicitly mention using Cursor for coding
- **AI allowed** - for documentation (unlike HOMEWORK writing components)
- **Cumulative** - later versions build on earlier versions

### Structure Template
```markdown
# 📌 TOOL

## App V[X]: [App Name/Description]

🕒 *Estimated Time: X hours*

---

## 📋 Tool Overview

### Content Guidelines
- **Concise**: Keep descriptions brief and direct
- **Deployment-focused**: Always emphasize deployment requirement
- **Checklist format**: Use simple checklists for app requirements
- **Value-oriented**: Emphasize value for stakeholders (especially in later versions)
- **Cumulative**: Reference previous versions when applicable

### Common Sections
- **"Tool Overview"** - What to build and what it compiles/builds on
- **"Instructions"** - Who, What, Why (each one sentence)
- **"Your App Must Have"** - Checklist of required features
- **"To Submit"** - Submission requirements with point allocation
- **"Important Notes"** - Key reminders and requirements

### Point Allocation
- **Total tool points: 100 pts**
- Common breakdown:
  - Deployed App Link: 10-25 pts
  - Functional App: 50-60 pts (often with sub-points for specific features)
  - App Description/Documentation: 25-30 pts
  - Team Members by Role: 0-5 pts (often 0 pts in later versions)
- Point values should sum to 100 pts
- Use consistent formatting: `[X pts]` for point values

### Team Roles
All roles should be developer/engineer focused. Common roles include:
- 🧪 Project Manager: System architecture, system integration, performance testing, deployment
- 🔌 Backend Developer: API integration, data processing, and data pipeline
- 🎨 Frontend Developer: UI/UX design, reactive components, and visual design
- 🤖 Prompt Engineer: AI integration, prompt engineering, and AI-powered insights
- 🤖 Agent Orchestration Engineer: Manage orchestration of agents, content pipeline
- 🛠️ Database Engineer: Manage database and RAG operations
- 📊 Data Engineer: Statistical analysis, data transformations, and visualizations
- 🚀 DevOps Engineer: Deployment, testing, and performance optimization
- 📊 Full Stack Developer: Integration across components, reactive text, and value boxes
- 🧪 QA Engineer: Quality assurance, testing, and validation

**Note**: Always emphasize that *everyone* is a developer.

## Formatting Standards

### Icons Usage
- **📌** for the main header (TOOL)
- **🕒** for time estimates
- **✅** for requirement sections ("Your App Must Have")
- **📋** for overviews
- **📝** for instructions and descriptions
- **🔗** for links (deployed app links)
- **📊** for functional app requirements
- **🛠️** for process diagrams
- **📚** for documentation
- **📤** for submission sections
- **⚠️** for important notes
- **👥** for team members

### Text Formatting
- **Bold** for:
  - Key terms and concepts
  - Important file names
  - App names and versions
  - Required features
  - Emphasis on critical information
- *Italics* for:
  - Time estimates
  - Subtle emphasis
- `Inline code` for:
  - File names
  - Commands
  - Code snippets
  - Function names
  - Technical terms

### File References
- **Always** use relative hyperlinks: [`filename.ext`](relative/path/to/file.ext)
- Link to images: `![Alt Text](relative/path/to/image.png)`
- Link to LAB files when referencing them: [`LAB_name.md`](path/to/LAB_name.md)
- **Deployment platforms**: Mention DigitalOcean, Posit Cloud Connect, or Posit Connect

### Lists
- Use `- [ ]` for required features checklist items
- Use `-` for informational items or role lists
- Use nested lists for sub-features
- Add icons to list items when helpful

---

## Writing Style

### Tone
- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Direct**: State requirements clearly and directly
- **Clear**: Specify exactly what students need to build
- **Supportive**: Acknowledge that this is a group effort

### Clarity
- Explain what the app should do
- Specify all required features clearly
- Provide examples when helpful
- Use simple language; define jargon inline

### Examples to Avoid
```markdown
❌ It is critical that you complete this step.
❌ Obviously, you should include deployment.
❌ As you can see, this is important.
```

### Examples to Use
```markdown
✅ Your app must be deployed and accessible online.
✅ Include a working link to your deployed app.
✅ Use AI to help create comprehensive documentation if needed.
```

## Footer Path Adjustment

The footer image path must be adjusted based on file location:

- Files in `docs/`: `![](images/homework.png)`
- Files one level deep (e.g., `04_deployment/`, `08_function_calling/`): `![](../docs/images/homework.png)`
- Files two levels deep: `../../docs/images/homework.png`
- Always use relative path to `docs/images/homework.png`

---

## Relationship to HOMEWORK Assignments

### Key Differences
- **TOOL**: Group assignment, deployment required, AI allowed for documentation
- **HOMEWORK**: Individual assignment, compilation of LABS, writing NOT AI-generated

### Similarities
- Both use similar structure (Overview, Instructions, Requirements, Submission)
- Both total 100 pts
- Both use same footer format
- Both reference LAB files

---

## Submission Format

### Standard Submission (V1)
- Submit a single .docx file
- Include all required components
- Links must be working and accessible

### Enhanced Submission (V2+)
- Submit a single .docx file containing:
  - Link to GitHub repository main page (contains all documentation)
  - Link to live app
  - Clear instructions on where to find answers to questions
- Make it very clear where instructor should look for documentation

---

## Common Requirements Across Versions

### Always Required
- **Deployment**: App must be deployed and accessible online
- **Working Link**: Deployed app link must work
- **Functional App**: App must run meaningful analysis
- **Documentation**: Sufficient documentation required

### Version-Specific Additions
- **V1**: Basic features (API, AI, ShinyApp)
- **V2**: Agentic Orchestration + (RAG OR Tool Calling)
- **V3**: [To be defined]

---

## AI Usage Policy

- **V1**: Documentation NOT AI-generated (student-written)
- **V2+**: AI is allowed for documentation (system is bigger)
- **Always**: AI can be used for coding - "I expect that the app will be good! :)"
- **Always**: Cursor is expected and encouraged for coding support
