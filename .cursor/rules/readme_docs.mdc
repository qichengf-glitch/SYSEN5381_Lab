# README and Markdown Documentation Rules

## Target Audience
- Graduate students in systems engineering
- Some prior coding experience in Python or R
- New to Git, AI, API queries, and related technologies
- Write with clarity and patience; assume limited prior knowledge

## Structure and Format

### Required Template Structure
Every README in a repository subfolder must follow the format defined in [`docs/prep/README_template.md`](docs/prep/README_template.md):

1. **Header Section**
   - Banner image with relative link (e.g., `![Banner Image](images/icons.png)`)
   - Title: `# README '/folder/filename'`
   - Brief 2-sentence topic description in blockquote

2. **Table of Contents**
   - Use relative anchor links to sections
   - Include subsections with proper indentation
   - **Primary purpose**: Show the order in which to complete activities/files
   - List activities in numbered order when sequence matters

3. **Main Content**
   - **Keep it concise**: READMEs are navigation guides, not detailed instructions
   - Use `##` for main sections
   - Use `###` for subsections
   - Maximum two heading levels
   - Focus on what files exist and in what order to use them
   - Avoid extensive descriptions; refer to individual files for details
   - **Required structure**: Always include an "Activities" section and a "Readings" section in this format:
     ```markdown
     ## Activities
     
     Complete these activities in order:
     
     1. [ACTIVITY: Human-Readable Activity Name](ACTIVITY_name.md)
         - [`related_file.sh`](related_file.sh) — brief description
         - [`related_file.py`](related_file.py) — brief description
     2. [READ: Human-Readable Reading Name](READ_name.md) — brief description (if part of workflow)
     3. [ACTIVITY: Human-Readable Next Activity Name](ACTIVITY_next.md)
     4. [LAB: Human-Readable Lab Name](LAB_name.md)
     
     ---
     
     ## Readings
     
     - [READ: Human-Readable Reading Name](READ_name.md) — brief description (if not in numbered sequence)
     - Or: `- None.` if no standalone readings
     ```
   - **Activities section**: Numbered list showing sequence. Use human-readable names (titles from the activity/reading files) as link text with the appropriate prefix (ACTIVITY:, READ:, LAB:), with the actual filename as the URL. Include ACTIVITY_, READ_, and LAB_ files that are part of the workflow. Sub-items (indented with `-`) list related files like example scripts.
   - **Readings section**: List any READ_ files that aren't part of the numbered sequence, or use `- None.` if there are no standalone readings. Use human-readable names with the READ: prefix as link text.

4. **Footer Section**
   - Footer image with relative link
   - "Back to Top" link with home icon: `← 🏠 [Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)`

### File References
- **Always** add relative hyperlinks when discussing files
- **For ACTIVITY_, READ_, and LAB_ files in lists**: Use human-readable names (titles) as link text with the appropriate prefix, with the actual filename as the URL
  - Format: `[ACTIVITY: Human-Readable Title](ACTIVITY_filename.md)`, `[READ: Human-Readable Title](READ_filename.md)`, `[LAB: Human-Readable Title](LAB_filename.md)`
  - Example: `[ACTIVITY: Run Ollama Locally](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md)` instead of ``[`ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md`](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md)``
  - Example: `[READ: Finding APIs](READ_find_apis.md)`
  - Example: `[LAB: Build an AI-Powered Data Reporter](LAB_ai_reporter.md)`
- **For code/script files**: Use the filename in backticks as link text
  - Format: ``[`filename.ext`](relative/path/to/file.ext)``
  - Example: See [`functions.R`](functions.R) for helper functions
- For code blocks, reference the file above or below the block

### Formatting Guidelines
- **Use formatting frequently**: bold (**text**), italics (*text*), and underline when appropriate
- **Bold** for emphasis on key terms, file names, or important concepts
- *Italics* for subtle emphasis or alternative phrasing
- Use inline code backticks for: file names, function names, commands, code snippets

### Icon Usage
- **Use icons frequently** throughout the document
- Reference available icons in [`docs/prep/icons.md`](docs/prep/icons.md)
- Use icons to:
  - Mark section headers (e.g., `## 🚀 Deployment`)
  - Highlight important notes (e.g., `🚨 Requirements`)
  - Indicate actions (e.g., `✅ Complete`, `⚠️ Warning`)
  - Add visual interest to lists and key points
- Common patterns:
  - 🚨 for critical/important sections
  - ✅ for completed items or checklists
  - ⚠️ for warnings or important notes
  - 📚 for documentation sections
  - 🔧 for technical/setup sections
  - 💡 for tips or insights

## Writing Style

### Tone and Voice
- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly; avoid unnecessary words
- **Humble**: Don't assume expertise; explain concepts clearly
- **Avoid blather**: Remove filler phrases and redundant explanations
- **Never use phrases like**:
  - "it is obvious"
  - "it is critical"
  - "clearly"
  - "obviously"
  - "as you can see"
  - "it goes without saying"
- Instead, state facts directly: "This step configures the API endpoint" rather than "It is critical that you configure the API endpoint"

### Clarity for Beginners
- Explain acronyms on first use: "REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)"
- Break complex steps into numbered or bulleted lists
- Provide context for why steps are needed when helpful
- Use simple, direct language; avoid jargon when possible
- When jargon is necessary, define it inline

### Code Examples
- Include practical, runnable code examples
- Add comments in code to explain non-obvious steps
- Reference the actual file when showing code snippets
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting for code blocks

## Content Organization

### Sections Should Include
- Clear, descriptive headings with icons when appropriate
- Brief introductory text for each section
- Step-by-step instructions when applicable
- Examples and code snippets
- Links to related files and resources
- Troubleshooting tips when relevant

### Lists and Checklists
- Use checkboxes for actionable items: `- [ ] Task to complete`
- Use bullet points for informational items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Add icons to list items when they enhance clarity

## Examples

### Good Activity/Reading/Lab Link Format
```markdown
1. [ACTIVITY: Run Ollama Locally](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md)
2. [ACTIVITY: Set Up Ollama API Key](ACTIVITY_ollama_api_key.md)
3. [READ: Finding APIs](READ_find_apis.md)
4. [LAB: Build an AI-Powered Data Reporter](LAB_ai_reporter.md)
```

### Avoid This Format
```markdown
1. [`ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md`](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md)
2. [Run Ollama Locally](ACTIVITY_ollama_local.md) (missing prefix)
```

### Good File Reference (for code/script files)
```markdown
See the [`plumber.R`](plumber.R) file for the API implementation.
```

### Good Section with Icon
```markdown
## 🚀 Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy your application...
```

### Good Formatting
```markdown
**Important**: Make sure to set your API key in the `.env` file before running the script.
```

### Avoid This
```markdown
It is critical that you understand this concept, as it is obvious that...
```

### Use This Instead
```markdown
This concept is used throughout the course. Understanding it helps with...
```
