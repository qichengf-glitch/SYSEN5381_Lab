# READ_, ACTIVITY_, and LAB_ Documentation Rules

## File Naming Convention
- **READ_** prefix: Reading/learning materials (e.g., `READ_digitalocean.md`)
- **ACTIVITY_** prefix: Hands-on activities with step-by-step instructions (e.g., `ACTIVITY_digitalocean_signup.md`)
- **LAB_** prefix: Lab exercises/assignments (e.g., `LAB_query_api.md`)

All three types follow the same basic structure with consistent headers and footers.

---

## Common Structure (All Types)

### Required Header Format
```markdown
# 📌 [TYPE]

## [Title/Name]

🕒 *Estimated Time: X minutes*
```

### Required Footer Format
```markdown
![](../../docs/prep/icons.png)

---

← 🏠 [Back to Top](#[TYPE])
```

**Note**: The footer image path should be adjusted based on file location. Use relative path to `docs/prep/icons.png`.

---

## READ_ Files (Reading Materials)

### Purpose
Educational content that explains concepts, tools, or topics. Students read these to learn before activities.

### Structure Template
```markdown
# 📌 READ

## [Topic Name]

🕒 *Estimated Time: X minutes*

---

## [Section 1]

Content explaining the topic...

## [Section 2]

More content...

---

![](../../docs/prep/icons.png)

---

← 🏠 [Back to Top](#READ)
```

### Content Guidelines
- **Explanatory**: Focus on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- **Educational**: Provide context, background, and conceptual understanding
- **Concise**: Keep explanations clear and to the point
- **Use formatting**: Bold key terms, italicize emphasis, use icons for visual interest
- **Include examples**: Reference real-world use cases or comparisons when helpful
- **Tables**: Use tables for comparisons (e.g., vendor comparisons, feature lists)

### Common Sections
- "What is [Topic]?" - Introduction and definition
- "What to Expect" - Practical expectations (costs, time, outcomes)
- "For Future Reference" - Additional resources or considerations
- Comparison tables for tools/services

### Example Pattern
```markdown
## What is **DigitalOcean**?

> Brief description with key points highlighted.

## What to Expect

- Practical expectations listed
- Cost information if relevant
- Time commitments

## For Future Reference

Additional context or resources...
```

## ACTIVITY_ Files (Hands-On Activities)

### Purpose
Step-by-step instructions for students to complete specific tasks. These are actionable guides.

### Header Requirements
- **"Your Task" header**: Always use exactly `## ✅ Your Task` with no additional description or text in the header itself
- **"To Submit" header**: Always use exactly `# 📤 To Submit` with no additional text in the header itself
- Any descriptions or explanations should go in the paragraph content below the headers, not in the header text

### Structure Template
```markdown
# 📌 ACTIVITY

## [Activity Name]

🕒 *Estimated Time: 10-15 minutes*

---

## ✅ Your Task

Brief 1-2 sentence description of what students will accomplish.

### 🧱 Stage 1: [Stage Name]

- [ ] Essential step 1
- [ ] Essential step 2
- [ ] Essential step 3

### 🧱 Stage 2: [Next Stage]

- [ ] Essential step 1
- [ ] Essential step 2

---

# 📤 To Submit

- For credit: [Brief submission requirements, e.g., screenshot]

---

![](../../docs/images/icons.png)

---

← 🏠 [Back to Top](#ACTIVITY)
```

### Content Guidelines
- **Action-oriented**: Every step should be clear and actionable
- **Checkboxes**: Only use `- [ ]` for actual tasks that users can check off as completed. Use regular bullets `-` for informational items, explanations, or non-actionable content
- **Stages**: Break complex activities into stages with `### Stage X:` or `### [Stage Name]:`. **Keep activities to 2-3 stages maximum**. If an activity is getting long or complex, consider splitting it into a second activity
- **Time estimates**: Activities should take **10-15 minutes** maximum. Keep instructions brief and focused.
- **Brevity**: Remove unnecessary bullet points. Consolidate steps where possible. Focus on essential actions only.
- **Screenshots**: Include images showing what students should see
- **Icons in stages**: Use icons like 🧱 for stages, 🔗 for links
- **File references**: Always link to files when mentioned: [`filename.ext`](path/to/file.ext)
- **Submission section**: Always include `# 📤 To Submit` with clear requirements
- **Submission format**: **Always require a screenshot** unless there's a special need for more (e.g., code file, written response). Keep submission requirements simple and consistent.
- **Length management**: Keep activities concise and focused. Avoid duplication between activities. If an activity exceeds 2-3 stages or becomes too long, suggest splitting it into multiple activities

### Step Formatting
- Use checkboxes: `- [ ]` only for actionable steps that users can check off
- Use regular bullets: `-` for informational items, explanations, or context that doesn't require action
- Bold important UI elements: "Select **Create** >> **App Platform**"
- Use inline code for technical terms: "Select the `main` branch"
- Include images after relevant steps with descriptive alt text
- Link to external resources: `[Link Text](URL)`

### Common Patterns
```markdown
## ✅ Your Task

In this activity, you will [brief description of what they'll accomplish].

### 🧱 Stage 1: [Stage Name]

- [ ] Step description (actionable task)
- [ ] Another step (actionable task)
- Context or explanation without checkbox

![Screenshot](../images/screenshot.png)

### Stage 2: [Next Stage]

- [ ] More actionable steps...

# 📤 To Submit

```

**Note**: Keep activities to 2-3 stages. If an activity is getting long, suggest splitting it into a second activity.

## LAB_ Files (Lab Exercises)

### Purpose

# 📌 LAB

## [Lab Name]

🕒 *Estimated Time: X minutes*

---

## Formatting Standards (All Types)

### Icons Usage
- **📌** for the main header (READ/ACTIVITY/LAB)
- **🕒** for time estimates
- **✅** for task sections
- **🧱** for stages/phases
- **🔗** for links
- **📤** for submission sections
- **💡** for tips
- **📋** for overviews/checklists
- Reference [`docs/prep/icons.md`](docs/prep/icons.md) for more options

### Text Formatting
- **Bold** for:
  - Key terms and concepts
  - UI element names (buttons, menus, etc.)
  - Important file names
  - Emphasis on critical information
- *Italics* for:
  - Time estimates
  - Subtle emphasis
  - Alternative phrasing
- `Inline code` for:
  - File names
  - Commands
  - Code snippets
  - Technical terms
  - Branch names, folder paths

### File References
- **Always** use relative hyperlinks: [`filename.ext`](relative/path/to/file.ext)
- Link to images: `![Alt Text](relative/path/to/image.png)`
- Link to external resources: `[Link Text](https://url.com)`

### Lists
- Use `- [ ]` for actionable steps that users can check off as completed (checkboxes)
- Use `-` for informational items, explanations, context, or non-actionable content
- Use numbered lists `1.` for sequential processes where order matters
- Add icons to list items when helpful
- **Important**: Only use checkboxes when referring to a specific task a user can check off as having done

### Images
- Include screenshots showing what students should see
- Use descriptive alt text
- Place images after relevant steps
- Use relative paths: `../images/filename.png` or `../../images/filename.png`

---

## Writing Style (All Types)

### Tone
- **Concise**: Get to the point; avoid unnecessary words
- **Humble**: Don't assume expertise; explain clearly
- **Direct**: State facts directly; avoid phrases like "it is obvious" or "it is critical"
- **Patient**: Remember audience is learning Git, AI, APIs for the first time

### Clarity
- Explain acronyms on first use
- Break complex steps into smaller sub-steps
- Provide context for why steps are needed
- Use simple language; define jargon inline

### Examples to Avoid
```markdown
❌ It is critical that you complete this step.
❌ Obviously, you should select the main branch.
❌ As you can see, this is important.
```

### Examples to Use
```markdown
✅ Complete this step to configure your API endpoint.
✅ Select the main branch from the dropdown menu.
✅ This step ensures your app deploys correctly.
```
