# HOMEWORK_ Documentation Rules

## File Naming Convention
- **HOMEWORK_** prefix: Formal homework assignments that compile results from several recent ACTIVITIES (e.g., `HOMEWORK_1.md`, `HOMEWORK_2.md`)
- Homeworks are concise compilation assignments that showcase individual progress over the last 2-3 weeks
- Each LAB represents the next step of a student's project, and homeworks compile these LABS into a cohesive showcase

## [Homework Name/Number]

🕒 *Estimated Time: X hours*
```

### Required Footer Format

## HOMEWORK_ Files (Homework Assignments)

### Purpose
Concise compilation assignments that showcase individual progress over the last 2-3 weeks. Students demonstrate their work by compiling deliverables from their LABS. Each homework requests a specific deliverable (e.g., an **AI-powered reporter software**) that represents the culmination of their activities so far.

### Structure Template
```markdown
# 📌 HOMEWORK

## [Homework Name/Number]

🕒 *Estimated Time: X hours*

### Content Guidelines
- **Concise**: Homeworks are compilation assignments, not lengthy question sets. Keep them brief and focused.
- **Showcase-focused**: Students demonstrate progress by compiling work, not answering questions.
- **Deliverable-oriented**: Each homework requests a specific deliverable (e.g., AI-powered reporter software).
- **Progress demonstration**: Emphasize showing individual progress over the last 2-3 weeks.
- **Required components**: Always specify the four required components:
  1. Writing component (NOT AI-generated)
  2. Git repository links (working and valid)
  3. Screenshots/samples of outputs
  4. Brief documentation (data tables, usage instructions, etc.)

### Common Sections
- **"Homework Overview"** - What students will showcase and how it relates to LABS
- **"Instructions"** - Who, what, why (each one sentence)
- **"Your Deliverable"** - Specific deliverable requested with detailed requirements checklist and point allocation
- **"To Submit"** - Brief submission reminder pointing to Requirements section

### Deliverable Formatting
- Use `### [Deliverable Name] [X pts]` for the main deliverable section
- Use checkboxes `- [ ]` with point values `**📝 [X pts] Component Name**` for required components
- **Total points must equal 100 pts** across all components
- Be specific about what the deliverable should demonstrate
- Reference which LABS this deliverable compiles
- Break down points logically (e.g., 25 pts for writing, 25 pts for git links, 25 pts for screenshots, 25 pts for documentation)

### Required Components

#### 1. Writing Component
- **Must NOT be AI-generated**: Explicitly state this requirement
- Brief explanation of the system
- Should explain what the system does and how it works
- Written in the student's own words

#### 2. Git Repository Links
- **Working and valid**: Links must be functional

- **Project continuity**: Emphasize that each LAB represents the next step of their project
- **Cumulative showcase**: Homeworks showcase cumulative progress, not just individual LAB work

### Point Allocation
- **Total homework points: 100 pts**
- Main deliverable section should indicate total points: `### [Deliverable Name] [100 pts]`
- Each required component should have clear point values: `**📝 [X pts] Component Name**`
- Point values should sum to 100 pts across all components
- Use consistent formatting: `[X pts]` for point values

## Formatting Standards

### Icons Usage
- **📌** for the main header (HOMEWORK)
- **🕒** for time estimates
- **✅** for task/deliverable sections
- **📋** for overviews
- **📝** for instructions and writing components
- **🔗** for links (git repository links)
- **📸** for screenshots
- **📚** for documentation
- **📤** for submission sections
- Reference [`docs/prep/icons.md`](docs/prep/icons.md) for more options

### Text Formatting
- **Bold** for:
  - Key terms and concepts
  - Important file names
  - Deliverable names
  - Required components
  - Emphasis on critical information (e.g., "NOT AI-generated")
- *Italics* for:
  - Time estimates
  - Subtle emphasis
  - Alternative phrasing
- `Inline code` for:
  - File names
  - Commands
  - Code snippets
  - Function names
  - Technical terms
  - Git repository paths

### File References
- **Always** use relative hyperlinks: [`filename.ext`](relative/path/to/file.ext)
- Link to images: `![Alt Text](relative/path/to/image.png)`
- Link to external resources: `[Link Text](https://url.com)`
- Link to LAB files when referencing them: [`LAB_name.md`](path/to/LAB_name.md)
- **Git repository links**: Use full URLs to GitHub/GitLab repositories: `[Link Text](https://github.com/user/repo/path/to/file)`

### Lists
- Use `- [ ]` for required components checklist items
- Use `-` for informational items, explanations, or context
- Use numbered lists `1.` for sequential processes where order matters
- Add icons to list items when helpful

### Tables
- Use markdown tables for data documentation
- Example data table format:
```markdown
| Column Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| id | integer | Unique identifier |
| name | text | Name of the item |
```

---

## Writing Style

### Tone
- **Concise**: Get to the point quickly; homeworks are compilation assignments, not lengthy question sets
- **Direct**: State requirements clearly and directly
- **Clear**: Specify exactly what students need to submit
- **Supportive**: Acknowledge that this showcases their progress

### Clarity
- Explain what the deliverable should be
- Specify all required components clearly
- Provide examples when helpful (e.g., what a good data table looks like)
- Use simple language; define jargon inline

### Examples to Avoid
```markdown
❌ It is critical that you complete this step.
❌ Obviously, you should include screenshots.
❌ As you can see, this is important.
```

### Examples to Use
```markdown
✅ Include screenshots showing your software in action.
✅ Provide working links to your git repository.
✅ Write a brief explanation of your system in your own words (NOT AI-generated).
```

## Relationship to LABS and ACTIVITIES

### Hierarchy
1. **ACTIVITIES** - Hands-on step-by-step instructions for specific tasks
2. **LABS** - Weekly assignments that represent the next step of a student's project (lightly depend on ACTIVITIES)
3. **HOMEWORKS** - Concise compilation assignments that showcase progress from 2-3 LABS

### Key Principles
- **LABS build on ACTIVITIES**: Students complete ACTIVITIES to learn concepts, then apply them in LABS
- **HOMEWORKS compile LABS**: Each homework compiles 2-3 LABS into a specific deliverable
- **Project continuity**: Each LAB represents the next step of the student's project
- **Progress showcase**: Homeworks demonstrate cumulative progress, not just individual LAB work
- **Deliverable-focused**: Each homework requests a specific deliverable (e.g., AI-powered reporter software)

### When Creating HOMEWORKS
- **Be concise**: Homeworks are compilation assignments, not lengthy question sets
- **Specify deliverable**: Clearly state what students need to create/showcase
- **Reference LABS**: Specify which LABS this homework compiles
- **Emphasize components**: Always include the four required components
- **Project context**: Reference that this is the culmination of their activities so far

### Example Homework Structure
- **Homework 1**: AI-powered reporter software (culmination of activities from LAB 1, LAB 2, LAB 3)
- **Homework 2**: [Next deliverable] (culmination of activities from LAB 4, LAB 5, LAB 6)
- Each homework requests a specific deliverable that demonstrates progress
